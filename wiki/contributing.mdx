### Step 5: Learn the Grammar of Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes formatting documents simple and efficient. It's widely used on GitHub and in this project.

1. **Start with Basic Markdown Syntax**
   - Learn the basics of Markdown, including headings, lists, links, and code blocks, from the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
   - This guide provides examples and explanations for creating structured, readable documentation.

2. **Explore Advanced Markdown Features**
   - Since this project uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), you can take advantage of its extended Markdown features, such as:
     - Embedding tabs
     - Including admonitions (alerts and callouts)
     - Custom components with MDX
   - To dive deeper into these advanced features, visit the [Docusaurus Markdown Features Documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).


Once you're comfortable with Markdown, you'll be ready to contribute effectively to the $Li Wiki documentation. Let's move to the next step!

### Step 6: Make Changes to the Wiki

Now that your environment is set up, you can start making contributions to the Wiki. Here's how to proceed:

#### **Modify Existing Pages**

1. Navigate to the `wiki` folder in your cloned repository:
   - The folder contains all the existing documentation files.

2. Open the file you want to edit in **VS Code** or **Cursor**:
   - Make improvements to the content, such as fixing typos, adding new sections, or updating outdated information.

3. Preview your changes locally (Optional):
   - If you've installed **Bun** or **Node.js**, you can run the local development server:
     ```bash showLineNumbers
     bun run start
     ```
     - This will launch the documentation site locally on `http://localhost:3000`.

4. Save your changes:
   - Commit your updates once you're satisfied with the edits (instructions in Step 7).

---

#### **Add New Pages**

1. **Create a New Markdown File**
   - Add a `.md` or `.mdx` (for advanced features) file in the appropriate folder under `wiki`.
   - For example, to create a new guide, place it in the `docs` folder.

2. **Register the Page in the Sidebar**
   - Open `src/sidebars.ts` in the root directory.
   - Add an entry for your new page under the appropriate section. For example:
     ```javascript
     {
       type: 'doc',
       id: 'your-new-page-id',
     }
     ```
     - Replace `your-new-page-id` with the file name (excluding the `.mdx` extension).

3. **Preview Locally**
   - Run the development server to verify that your new page is rendered correctly:
     ```bash
     bun run start
     ```

---

#### **Set Up Multi-Language Support**

If you want to make your contribution multilingual:

1. Navigate to the `i18n` folder:
   - This folder contains translations for different languages.

2. Add translations for your content:
   - Create a subfolder for the language (if it doesn't already exist), such as `i18n/zh-CN` for Simplified Chinese.

3. Copy the content of your `.mdx` file into the language-specific folder:
   - Translate the content into the target language.

4. Test the multilingual feature:
   - Build the site and check if the translations are displayed correctly.
   - **Note**: use `bun run start` will not work for multi-language support, you need to use `bun run build` and then `bun run serve` to see the changes.

---

#### **Write in Any Language**

- You can choose to write your contributions in any language you're comfortable with.
- After submission, the maintainers will review your changes and coordinate translations into other languages.

---

### Step 7: Submit Your Changes

Now that you've made changes to the Wiki, it's time to submit them to the main repository. Follow this guide to share your contributions:

#### **For Beginners: Simple Guide**

1. **Stage Your Changes**
   - Add the files you modified to the staging area:
     ```bash showLineNumbers
     git add .
     ```

2. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Save your changes with a descriptive commit message:
     ```bash showLineNumbers
     git commit -m "Add new page for contributing guide"
     ```

3. **Push Your Changes**
   - Push your changes to your forked repository:
     ```bash showLineNumbers
     git push -u origin main
     ```

4. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click the **"Compare & pull request"** button.
